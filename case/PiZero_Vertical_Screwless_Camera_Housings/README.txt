# Summary

This housing is designed to hold a Pi Zero and camera board in a vertical format suitable for wall, stand or 2020 extrusion mounting. It slides together and doesn't require any screws. The SD card is not accessible from the outside to protected it.

Two designs are included: short and deep (Vert) or tall and thin (Tall).  The vert clamp piece applies to both formats.

The cases feature a GoPro compatible mount and I've included a suitable stand, mounting bracket and extension.  These need an M5x20 bolt/cap screw and nut although an M5x15 will do it you have them available.

Everything is printable without support. The top piece is designed to print upside down and may benefit from a small amount depending on how your printer/filament copes with overhangs.

Update 09/08/16
 At the request of stephenway, I've added a modified Vert Base (PiZeroCamCaseVertBaseLights.STL) with holes and mounting for the "Bright White and IR Camera Light for Raspberry Pi" available from various locations including http://www.robotshop.com/en/bright-white-ir-camera-light-raspberry-pi.html.  I haven't printed this case as I don't have the board, but the dimensions where taken from the PCB board definition file so should be close.  You will probably have to solder the wires directly to the Pi Zero as I don't think there is space to fit header pins and sockets.
