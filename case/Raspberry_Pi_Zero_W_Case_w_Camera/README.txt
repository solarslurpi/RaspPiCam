# Summary

This is a remake of Dimwit-Dave's [Raspberry Pi Zero WiFi Camera Case](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2254307) I really like how small a case he packed the Pi and camera into but, I have a Pi Zero W and a V2 Camera and the mounting holes for the camera or the board didn't line up correctly for me so I copied his awesome design and made it fit my Pi and Camera. 

I'm only using this with MotionEyeOS so ~Case.stl just has a cut out for power... while ~Case 2.stl has cutout for the other two plugs.

*** Note - This will not work with the short 40mm camera cable. ***

**4/19/18 - ** On request I added a few new STL's that "should be able to be used with this [Modular Mounting System](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2194278)

***Pi Zero Case Arm Mount.STL***  is a whole new case that should mount right up.
***Pi Zero Case Cover Arm.STL*** and ***Pi Zero Arm.STL*** can be super glued together and mounted that way.

Keep in mind.... I have not tried printing either of these new pieces myself.

***6-4-18 = Fixed the Pi_Zero_Case_Arm_Mount.STL to have the cutout for the nut retainer on the covers (so any of the covers should fit now.)***

The Case & Cover.

![Alt text](https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/63/f4/fa/c9/5b/Pi_Zero_W_Case002.jpg)
Required Hardware = (8) 2-56 x 1/4" screws, (4) 2-56" x 1/8" screws, and a 1/4-20 nut.

![Alt text](https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/58/4f/a4/d2/72/Pi_Zero_W_Case003.jpg)
Mount the camera with at least (2) of the 1/8" long 2-56 screws. (I just cut down and filed flat some 1/4" screws as thats all I could find at the hardware store.)

Lay the board in the case so the ribbon cable lays as shown.

Mount the board to the case with at least (2) of the 1/4" 2-56 screws and place the nut in the bottom space.

Mount the cover with 4 of the 1/4" 2-56 screws.

![Alt text](https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/0b/98/37/be/83/Pi_Zero_W_Case007.jpg)
The case can now be hung with a screw using the slot in the rear of the cover or mounted to a tripod using the nut.
